## Task 4: Modify agent to automatically respond in the language of the question/user

Edit the agent and change the description and the general instructions. Note that the description is not responsible for the behavior of the agent. The general instructions is the one that changes the agent's behavior. Changing the description just keeps the description in line with the general instructions.
