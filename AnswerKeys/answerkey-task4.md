## Task 4: Modify agent to automatically respond in the language of the question/user

Edit the agent and change the description and the general instructions. Note that the description is not responsible for the behavior of the agent. The general instructions is the one that changes the agent's behavior. Changing the description just keeps the description in line with the general instructions.

Now, when you test the agent, asking the agent a question in French will also result in you getting a response in French because that is the language you used for the question. However, the source in the citation is in Mandarin. If you ask it a different question in any of the [other supported languages](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/supported-languages-for-microsoft-365-copilot-94518d61-644b-4118-9492-617eea4801d8) in Microsoft Copilot, it will respond in that language.
